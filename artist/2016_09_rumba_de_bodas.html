                RUMBA de BODAS formed in 2008, from the union of eight musician with very different energies, experiences and ideas. Over the years it developed an exquisitely singular style, which blends together latin grooves, Balkan, Swing, Ska and Reggae and has
                had people dancing under stages everywhere from Italy to London, and from Romania to Spain.

                They love brass sections, upbeat music, all sort of traditional folky sort of stuff, but mainly they love to mix all of this together, throwing in half a kilo of chili powder to make sure you're going to stomp your feet as much as possible. It is this
                very mix of genres, freely mixing south American vibes, Middle European melodies and Ska, the whole mixed up with a touch of Carnival Jazziness.

            <blockquote>They played more than 200 shows in China, the USA and Europe and gained several prices for their work. Together they form GINKGOA,- alias Nicolle Rochelle and Antoine Chatenet- and they create a colorful mix out of french chansons with american
                vibes and american songs with french touch. Their musical influences lie in current pop melodies, Swing of the old New York and it reaches to modern Electro. Inspired by artists such as Caro Emerald or Caravan Palace, they are a real experience
                when you see them live.</blockquote>
